This is a repo to practice and enjoy some basic algorithms that are used in developer's life

We have in some languages, mainly in Javascript(NodeJS), Python and maybe Golang!

### What is big O notation ?

<h4>Big O notation is special notation that tells you how fast an algorithm is.</h4>

Here are five big O run times that you’ll encounter a lot, sorted from
fastest to slowest:

- O(log n): also known as log time. Example: binary search.
- O(n): also known as linear time. Example: simple search.
- O(n * log n): Example: a fast sorting algorithm, like quicksort.
- O(n^2): Example: a slow sorting algorithm, like selection sort.
- O(n!): n factorial, Example: a really slow algorithm, like the traveling salesperson.

Notes:

- Binary search is a lot faster than simple search as your array gets
bigger.
O(log n) is faster than O(n), and it gets a lot faster once the list of
items you’re searching through grows.
- Algorithm speed isn’t measured in seconds.
- Algorithm times are measured in terms of growth of an algorithm.
- Algorithm times are written in big O notation.
